Here's my adam device tree for android 4.0.1 ASOP.

Copy to android/device/notionink/adam/

run extract-files.sh or copy-files.sh that'll create your vendor directory

go back to source root

Shell Type: ". build/envsetup.sh"

Let it finish.

Shell Type: "lunch full_adam-userdebug"

Wait for it to get done.

Then type: "time make -j16" (replace 16 with whatever your machine can handle.)
